        <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
        
        <p>HTML, short for Hypertext Markup Language, is a foundational language that plays a crucial role in creating and organizing content on the World Wide Web. It forms the backbone of virtually every webpage you encounter online, providing the essential framework for displaying text, images, videos, and interactive elements seamlessly across various devices and platforms. <div><img src="https://tinyurl.com/4vebmz35" alt="Html image" ></div></p>

        <h2>Origins and Development</h2>
        <p>HTML emerged during the early days of the internet in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Its development was driven by the need for a standardized system to create and link electronic documents within a universal information space where everyone could access it. </p>

        <h2>Inventor of HTML</h2>
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), is credited as the inventor of HTML. His pioneering efforts laid the groundwork for the World Wide Web as we know it today, facilitating easy access and navigation of interconnected information resources. <div><img src="https://tinyurl.com/2m5vvpbs" alt="Tim Berners-Lee at work"></div></p>

        <h2>Role in Web Development</h2>
        <p>HTML operates on a fundamental principle of defining the structure and elements of a webpage using a system of markup. This system, enclosed within angle brackets, provides instructions to web browsers on how content should be displayed and organized. While HTML primarily focuses on content structure, it coordinates with other languages like CSS for styling and Java script for interactivity.All these languages combined formed a fully functioning and good looking website. <div><img src="https://tinyurl.com/mv7m8djh" alt="syntax of html"></div></p>

        <h2>COMPONENTS OF HTML SYNTAX:</h2>
        <p>The main component of html syntax are tags</p>

        <h3>What are tags?</h3>
        <p>An HTML tag is a code enclosed in angle brackets that tells a web browser how to display content on a webpage. It's used to define different elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. Tags usually come in pairsâ€”an opening tag (<tag>) and a closing tag (</tag>), with content in between. </p>
        <h4><u>Types of tags:</u></h4>
        <p>There are two types of tags <strong>Container Tags</strong>and <strong>Empty Tags</strong></p>

        <h5>1.Container tag:</h5>
            A container tag in HTML is a type of tag that comes in pairs, consisting of an opening tag (<tag>) and a closing tag (</tag>)

            <h5>2.Empty tag:</h5>
                An empty tag in HTML is a tag that doesn't require a closing tag. It consists of a single tag, typically ending with a forward slash (/>).

        <h4><strong><u>Contents of a tag:</u></strong></h4>

        <h5>1. Opening Tag:</h5>
        The opening tag of an HTML element is the starting point that defines the beginning of the element's effect on content. It is enclosed in angle brackets (< and >).

        <h5>1. Closing tag:</h5>
        It is used to close the tag opening and closing tags have content between them

        <h5>3. Attributes:</h5>
        Attributes provide additional information about an element and are included within the opening tag. Attributes consist of a name and a value, separated by an equal sign (=). Examples include href in anchor tag and src in image tag different attributres are used in different tags 
        
        <h5>4. Content (for non-empty elements):</h5>
        The content of an HTML element is the information or text that appears between the opening and closing tags. For example, within <p> and </p>, the content is the paragraph text.


        <h5>5. Closing Tag (for non-empty tags):</h5>
        Many HTML elements have a closing tag that marks the end of the element's effect on content. It is similar to the opening tag but includes a forward slash (/) before the element name inside angle brackets (</ and >).
